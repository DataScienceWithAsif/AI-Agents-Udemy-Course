design_task:
  description: >
    Take the high level requirements described here and prepare a detailed design for the engineer;
    everything should be in 1 python module; describe the function and method signatures in the module.
    The python module must be completely self-contained, and ready so that it can be tested or have a simple UI built for it.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
    The module should be named {module_name} and the class should be named {class_name}
    IMPORTANT: Only output the design in markdown format, laying out in detail the classes and functions in the module, describing the functionality.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed design for the engineer, identifying the classes and functions in the module.

code_task:
  description: >
    Write a python module that implements the design described by the engineering lead, in order to achieve the requirements.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
  expected_output: >
    A python module that implements the design and achieves the requirements.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.

frontend_task:
  description: >
    Write a gradio UI in a module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class in {module_name}.
    Assume there is only 1 user, and keep the UI clean and attractive - just a prototype or demo.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
  expected_output: >
    A gradio UI in module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class.
    The file should be ready so that it can be run as-is, in the same directory as the backend module, and it should import the backend class from {module_name}.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.

evaluation_task:
  description: >
    Evaluate the given backend and frontend code and provide feedback on the code and update the code if needed.
  expected_output: >
    A feedback on the code and update the code if needed that is executable and ready to be saved and executed.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.
    IMPORTANT: combine the backend and frontend code into a single file
