# accounts.py Module Design

## Overview
The module `accounts.py` provides a self-contained implementation of a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. The main functionality allows users to manage accounts, execute trades, and maintain accurate records of transactions and portfolio valuations, while enforcing constraints to prevent invalid operations.

## Class Definitions

### Class `Account`
Represents an individual user's account, capable of managing funds, executing trades, and maintaining transaction history.

#### Attributes
- `id` (int): Unique account identifier.
- `balance` (float): Current available funds in the account.
- `initial_deposit` (float): The initial amount deposited into the account.
- `holdings` (dict): A dictionary that maps share symbols to quantities owned, e.g. `{'AAPL': 10, 'TSLA': 5}`.
- `transactions` (list): A list of transaction records, each a dictionary storing transaction details.

#### Methods

```python
def __init__(self, id: int, initial_deposit: float) -> None:
    """
    Initializes a new account with a unique ID and initial deposit.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def deposit(self, amount: float) -> None:
    """
    Deposits funds into the account.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool:
    """
    Withdraws funds from the account if sufficient balance exists.
    Returns True if withdrawal was successful, False otherwise.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:
    """
    Attempts to buy shares of the given symbol and quantity.
    Returns True if the purchase was successful, False otherwise.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:
    """
    Attempts to sell shares of the given symbol and quantity.
    Returns True if the sale was successful, False otherwise.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def portfolio_value(self) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the total value of the user's portfolio based on current share prices.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def profit_or_loss(self) -> float:
    """
    Calculates and returns the profit or loss since initial deposit.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def report_holdings(self) -> dict:
    """
    Returns a dictionary representing the current holdings in the account.
    """
    pass
```

```python
def transaction_history(self) -> list:
    """
    Returns a list of all transactions made over time.
    """
    pass
```

## Helper Function

```python
def get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float:
    """
    Mock function to return fixed share prices for symbols.
    """
    prices = {'AAPL': 150.0, 'TSLA': 700.0, 'GOOGL': 2700.0}
    return prices.get(symbol, 0.0)
```

The `Account` class along with its methods provides a comprehensive structure for managing a trading account, ensuring constraints are respected and that all functionalities operate correctly within the simulated trading environment.

This design encapsulates all required functionalities in a modular and testable format, ready to be integrated with a simple UI or testing framework.
